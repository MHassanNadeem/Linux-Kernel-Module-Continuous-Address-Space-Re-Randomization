This thesis came to fruition thanks to the support and advice of many people, here I would like to mention some of them:

Dr. Binoy Ravindran, my advisor, for taking me in his research group and providing me with the opportunity to work with amazingly talented colleagues. I would like to thank Dr. Binoy for his valuable guidance that shaped this thesis.

Dr. Ruslan Nikolaev, for working very closely with me every step of the way. This thesis would not have been possible without Ruslan's hands-on involvement in this project. I am grateful for all the times he spent in debugging sessions with me.

I would like to thank my committee members Dr. Hicks and Dr. Yao for agreeing to be on my committee. Thanks for taking the time to review and provide feedback on my thesis. 

My fellow researchers in Systems Software Research Group who kept me company through the thick and thin of research work and were ever willing to provide help and advice.

Finally, I would like to thank my parents. I would not have made this far if it were not for their dedication towards my education.
